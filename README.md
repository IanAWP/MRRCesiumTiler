For a more detailed writeup and explanation of the code, [head to my developer pages.](https://ianawp.github.io/)

### Usage and Requirements

Right now the project supports single field, single banded MRR input grids in the WGS84 Projection.
For legal reasons it is impossible to include the necessary MRR assemblies in this project. You will need a license for MapInfo Pro or a demo version to build and run the MRR Tile generator.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is required to run electron/Cesium

Navigate to the cesium folder and install using.
```Batchfile
npm install -d
```
Google go and the [Cesium Terrain Server](https://github.com/geo-data/cesium-terrain-server) are also required for tile hosting. *Do remember that a layers.json file is required at the root level of the terrain server*.  I've uploaded one that matches the output format used by the MRR generator.

After setup, run the electron app with 
```Batchfile
node_modules\.bin\electron .
```
You will need to provide the tileserver base url, as well as the name of the tileset generated by the MRR tile generator.

### Format support
Should work on anything the MRR API can read. Tested on MRR, Tin formats.
